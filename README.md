### Hi there, it's me, Matteo 👋

A tech enthusiast with a knack for crafting and nurturing cutting-edge web applications.

My journey so far has brought me from writing robust applications with modern front-end technologies to orchestrating serverless systems ensuring high scalability and performance 🚀.

With a solid foundation in various tech stacks, I strive to leverage the best practices in delivering B2B and B2C solutions 💼. I'm comfortable working with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP, harnessing their potential to optimize project deliverables 🌥️.

Beyond code, I have a penchant for digital marketing and SEO, always keen on exploring the business dynamics to provide comprehensive product solutions 📈
